# flutter-add-to-app
An example of adding Flutter to an existing Android app, with predictive back working.

The Android app and the Flutter module are in separate directories.

## Building
If making changes to the Flutter module, then in the
`add_to_app_flutter_module/` directory, run the following:

```
flutter build aar
```

Then rebuild the Android app and your changes will be reflected.
